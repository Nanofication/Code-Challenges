Solving python programming exercises posed by Zhiwehu

"""

"""
Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but
are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence
on a single line.

"""

"""
Find numbers between two other numbers that are also included.
It is divisible by one number but not by the other.
"""

    for i in range(minimum, maximum):
        if (i % isFactor == 0) and (i % notFactor != 0):
            print str(i) + ", ",

"""

Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

"""
Computes the factorial of a given number
"""
def Factorial(number):
    if (number == 1):
        return 1
    return (number * Factorial(number - 1))

#----------------------------------------#
"""
Question 3
Level 1

Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that
contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n
(both included).
and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

"""

Maps the index in a dictionary to its squared value

"""
def MapToSquare(maxNum):
    squaredIndices = dict()
    for i in range(1, maxNum + 1):
        squaredIndices[i] = i * i
    print squaredIndices

#----------------------------------------#
"""
Question 4
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from
console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
